# Trees
is a type for a data structure

## Challenge
* Create a Node class 
* Create a BinaryTree class
* Create a BinarySearchTree class

## Approach & Efficiency
* Node: 
    - time O(1)
    - space O(1)
* binary Tree: 
    - time O(1)
    - space O(1)
* Binary Search tree: 
    - time O(n)
    - space O(1)

## API 
* Binary Tree:
    * preOrder
    * inOrder
    * postOrder
    * which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.


* Binary Search Tree:
    * add:accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

    * contain:that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
